# Planned
- i want to have a graphical represenation for mathematical functions
- infrastructure should be seperated from gui and data, that is calculated or other IO operations
- as extra functionality i also want to implement a solver for:
    - Equations
    - Integrals, Derivatives (numerical and analytical)
    - Partial-Differential-Equations

# TODO
